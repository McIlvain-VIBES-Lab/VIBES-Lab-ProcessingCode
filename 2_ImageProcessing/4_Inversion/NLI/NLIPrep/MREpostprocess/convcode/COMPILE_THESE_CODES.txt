In the command window, use something like

gfortran MREpostprocessv9.f90 -o MREpostprocessv9.x

if you dont have the gfortran compiler, try g95 or ifort or ask your computing peeps.

You will also need to update the paths to this file in output_submitfile_v9p37_Caviness.m (line 119), and MRE_v9_process_folder.m (line 60)

MREpostprocessv9MF.f90 is from Eli, it works for multifrequency runs but not single frequency so dont use it.
